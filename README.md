# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exams 2020 - CLF-C01

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner ( CLF-C01 ) is one of the top paying IT certifications and your gateway to learning Amazon Web Services and acquiring more AWS Certifications.

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is intended for individuals who have the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively demonstrate an overall understanding of the AWS Cloud, independent of specific technical roles addressed by other AWS certifications (for example, AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, AWS Certified Developer Associate, or AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate). It is recommended to take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam first before getting any Associate level certification, especially for those who are new to cloud. Take your career and salary to the next level with an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification!

Some people are using brain dumps for the AWS CCP exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining an in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result with you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.

Please also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 1000++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice tests are meant to do.

These AWS Cloud Practitioner practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam domains such as Cloud Concepts and Technology, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS CCP exam guide.

There are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market, however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that may cause you to fail the actual exam. There are also official certification practice exams provided by AWS but these only have 20 or 40 questions and cost 20 or 30 USD -- a price that is comparable with having these 260 Unique and Timed Amazon Web Services practice questions!

We gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your CCP exam. All the best!



# IMPORTANT NOTE

These AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice exams have a passing score of 70% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.

Remember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these CCP practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!

Who this course is for:
For those who are about to take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam
For all professionals who want to gauge their AWS Knowledge for their upcoming job interview
For those in a non-tech position but regularly work with IT professionals i.e. Project Managers, Business Analysts, Business Managers, etc.
For anyone who want to take their career, and salary, to a whole new level with an AWS certification!
